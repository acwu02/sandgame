# Sandgame
This is a lightweight falling sand game I made, built from a simple physics engine I developed from the ground up. 
It has gone through many iterations at this point: I first developed it as a prototype in summer 2022, 
then refined it for submission as a class project in spring 2023.
Finally, I added some finishing touches and published it on itch.io in summer 2023.

Inspired by old falling sand games incl. "Powder Game" by Dan-Ball,
and the Stanford CS106A assignment "Sand", developed by Nick Parlante and Dave Feinberg
